## Course rationale

::: {.bg-washed-blue .b--dark-blue .ba .bw2 .br3 .shadow-5 .ph4 .mt2}
-   **DAL (Data Analysis for LEL)** is a new course designed for undergraduate students.

-   The main learning objective of this course is to allow you to **conduct basic data reports** which can be applied to linguistic questions and data, for example as part of your dissertation.

-   We will focus on **modern techniques** of data handling and quantitative analysis.

::: {.bg-washed-yellow .b--orange .ba .bw2 .br3 .shadow-5 .ph4 .mt2}
-   This is **not a programming course**. (For that, see the [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz) book).

-   There will be little maths.

-   The course covers the basics, but you will very likely have to learn something extra for your dissertation.

-   We will not cover inferential statistics (including significance testing).

## Statistics as an art and as a science {background-color="var(--inverse)"}

<br>

[Statistic is both a science and an art]{.f2}

[It is a ***science*** in that its methods are basically systematic and have general application and an ***art*** in that their successful application depends, to a considerable degree, on the skill and special experience of the statistician, and on his knowledge of the field of application.]{.f4}

---L. H. C. Tippett
